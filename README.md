# tensorlib
A minimal autograd library, implemented in c and wrapped in Python. 

# TODO to get the base functionality right:

- Fix the arange function
- Check what other function torch has to instantiate tensors
- Make sure there are no memory problems with creation

# AFTER:

- Add the operations, add, mul, matmul
- Add slicing operations on multidimensional tensors

# AFTER THAT:

- Implement the Function node
- Make sure we can backpropagate gradients
